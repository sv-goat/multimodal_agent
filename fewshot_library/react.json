The y-axis is labeled \"PER 1000\" with values from 0.2 to 0.3, and the x-axis shows years from 1950 to 1980. The legend indicates the solid line is for \"ACTUAL\" data. I need to find the value for the year 1975 on the \"ACTUAL\" line. Locating 1975 on the x-axis and moving up to the solid line, the point aligns with the y-axis value of 0.28.\nFinal Answer: 0.28"
