    "sample_0": "Image path: images/sample_0.png \\n Question Types: ['figure/diagram'] \\n Q: What is the ‘actual’ value per 1000, during the year 1975? \\n A: Let's think step by step. \\n 1.  The image is a line graph titled 'AGE ADJUSTED MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT MORTALITY RATE CANADA'. \\n 2.  The Y-axis is labeled 'PER 1000' and ranges from 0.2 to 0.3. \\n 3.  The X-axis represents years from 1950 to 1980. \\n 4.  The legend indicates that the solid line represents 'ACTUAL' data. \\n 5.  The question asks for the 'actual' value in the year 1975. \\n 6.  Locating 1975 on the X-axis and following it up to the solid 'ACTUAL' line, the point is near the peak of the graph. \\n 7.  Looking across to the Y-axis, this peak aligns with the label 0.28. \\n 8.  Therefore, the final answer is 0.28. \\n Final Answer: 0.28"
