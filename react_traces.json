They are best qualified to examine the efforts and objectives of their colleagues, to set priorities, and to assist in obtaining an appropriate balance within the health-related research effort. To investigate how NIH might avail itself of this expertise, Dr. Joseph C. Hwang, Chief of the Scientific Evaluation Section, Office for Research Analysis and Evaluation in the Division of Research Grants, suggested that the Division conduct a series of evaluation conferences. The proposal was endorsed by the then Associate Director for Research Analysis and Evaluation, Dr. Arley T. Bever, and four conferences were held in the fall of 1968. The conference dealing with Nutrition and Developmental Biology forms the basis for this report.\n\nIt is hoped that this report and the others resulting from these conferences will suggest a possible format for future evaluation of scientific fields that will provide an improved rationale for allocation choices.\"\n\nFinal Answer: Dr. Joseph C. Hwang was the chief of the scientific evaluation section."

NIH has always believed that the persons most capable of evaluating a scientific field are scientists themselves -- on the NIH staff or elsewhere in the scientific community. They are best qualified to examine the efforts and objectives of their colleagues, to set priorities, and to assist in obtaining an appropriate balance within the health-related research effort. To investigate how NIH might avail itself of this expertise, Dr. Joseph C. Hwang, Chief of the Scientific Evaluation Section, Office for Research Analysis and Evaluation in the Division of Research Grants, suggested that the Division conduct a series of evaluation conferences. The proposal was endorsed by the then Associate Director for Research Analysis and Evaluation, Dr. Arley T. Bever, and four conferences were held in the fall of 1968. The conference dealing with Nutrition and Developmental Biology forms the basis for this report.\n\nFinal Answer: Four conferences were held in the fall of 1968."
